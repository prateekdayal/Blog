Most people in the web business love talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Search engine optimization</a> (SEO) and there is a lot of material, software etc available on the net to help you out. But there are lots of legends floating around too. Some of them are (I am not sure if they are true or false)

<ul><li>Google does not index swf files</li><li>Google does not index a lot of dynamic content so have .html in your urls</li><li>many more :)

I recently ran into this very interesting post on the official google webmaster that talks about <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/03/first-date-with-googlebot-headers-and.html">how the googlebot works</a>. I think it answers a lot of questions people generally have so thought of sharing it on the blog.
