There were days when internet companies used to launch and not enter private alphas, public betas and other such states. Then came the concept of release early release often in the web and sites would not wait forever but release a beta and let the most enthusiastic users in. These users would brave broken functionality and help the developers test their product with some live audience. Then came gmail and orkut with their (fake) betas and redefined the meaning of the word. Suddenly it was uncool to not be beta untill you have a few million users. <a href="http://www.kaatizone.com/">Kaati zone</a> is suddenly bringing in all the web 2.0 coolness to their food joints. <a href="http://www.erasmic.com/">Erasmic ventures</a> has invested in the company and there seems to be a lot of buzz around it mostly for the fact that Kiran Nadkarni, the founder and director has been a VC.

Impressed by all this I tried out the new Kaati Zone in Banashankari last night. We entered the joint full of smoke (not out of fire but cooking smoke). We enquired and found out that they had not (yet) installed exhaust fans. The place was extremely noisy as they had not installed any sound absorption either. The menu looked nice and we finally ordered and the long wait started. After about 30 mins .. two of the three things ordered were done. Surprisingly the parathe Nithya had ordered arrived cold. They certainly did not look like they were cooked in the last 15 minutes or so. Other stuff was average too. When everybody was done, my roll arrived and as I had expected it was quite average. Some tables had chutney and others were offered package sauce. The decor however was cool because they had put some collage with pics from Bangalore street.

I frankly have no motivation to go back to that place when they have completed it because I felt the basic reason for going there (food) is not worth it in itself. On top of that I don't like the concept of a beta joint. May be when some other people do it and it become a cult, I will follow and appreciate how cool it is. My only suggestion to Kaati Zone would be to make sure they serve awesome food. I have had much better rolls in smaller joints that are considered quite uncool. Growth plans are cool but a chain is no good if you cannot keep up the quality.

Have you ever had a beta experience in any other offline product ?
