<a href="http://hungrybangalore.com">HungryBangalore.com</a> lets you order food online in Bangalore. The website is part of the <a href="http://hungryzone.com/">hungryzone</a> group but online ordering is currenly available only in Bangalore. You can however find reviews and contact details of  restaurents in many other cities like Bhopal, Delhi, Goa etc. I live in Bangalore and I tried the service finally yesterday and was quite impressed with the number of restaurants they have (even in not so restaurant-ish localities in bangalore like mine).

Ordering process begins by choosing your locality from the list on the main page and then you can select cuisine and/or restaurant. You can see the average cost of the meal per person and decide if its in the budget that you are looking for. I liked the fact that the menu can be looked up both in vegetarian and non veg categories as well as by food type (Soup, Starters, Rice etc). Thats how its arranged in a typical menu at restaurant but its just much easier to lookup here as once you get used to their layout, every restaurant's menu has the same layout.  :)

I live in Banashankari and ordered from <a href="http://bangalore.hungryzone.com/index.php/restaurant/Bawarchi/684">Bawarchi</a>. My food arrived pretty quickly. I think in less than 30 mins. I got an email after ordering and one more after my order was placed at the restaurant. I got a call from the restaurant before delivery to get the exact location.

All in all I found the service quite compelling and very useful. Some benefits I felt are
<ul>
	<li>You don't need to hunt around the house for menu</li>
	<li>No wasting money on calls while the menu is read out to you when you finally can't find it :)</li>
	<li>I think there is some kind of user loyalty program in form of points collected on every order</li>
	<li>I did not try it but if you want to speak and order, you can do that too. No need to order online</li>
	<li>You pay when you get your food, so no credit card transaction required.</li>
	<li>The service is free. Nothing extra is added to your bill</li>
</ul>
I think the usability of the final ordering process can be improved a bit but that should not stop you from using the website. If you are enthusiastic, you can also review the restaurant you just ordered from.

I generally don't review too many websites. The last I reviewed was <a href="http://prateekdayal.net/blog/2007/12/05/flipkartcom-finally-a-reasonably-priced-online-bookstore-in-india/">flipkart</a> because thats another service I found to be very compelling. I hope you will give <a href="http://hungrybangalore.com">hungrybangalore</a> a try and let me know your experience with it.
