I have lately been trying to understand how virality and WOM works. I know that if your service is compelling enough, many users will talk about you. But what I have been discovering in the last few weeks is that you can also structure your application, the flow etc in such a way that users are motivated to invite their friends. 

Why would the users invite their friends? There could be a number of reasons

1. The place is more fun with friends around (<a href="http://orkut.com">orkut</a>)
2. You may actually have some monetary benefits (such as <a href="http://makemytrip.com">makemytrip</a>)
3. It may just help you unlock some features of the website (mostly applicable to facebook/opensocial apps)

There are a couple of interesting articles on the net .... I am trying to dig more information about this stuff ... here is what I have found so far. 

<a href="http://framethink.wordpress.com/2008/01/15/the-four-viral-app-objectives-aka-social-network-application-virality-101/">The Four Viral App Objectives (a.k.a., “Social network application virality 101″)</a>

I was amazed to find out that stanford actually had a <a href="http://captology.stanford.edu/facebook">class on facebook apps last fall</a>

As I work towards building an opensocial app (followed by a facebook app) for <a href="muziboo.com">Muziboo.com</a>, I will be posting more stuff on applications, virality etc. If you have some resources, please leave them as comments and I will update the list with them
