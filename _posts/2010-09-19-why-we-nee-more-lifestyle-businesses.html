I have been in Vietnam for last two months and for most part, I have been living in Ho Chi Minh City. Near my hotel is a cafe called Ca fe Tinhte. Its the best cafe I have known for people to sit and work from. There is free wifi and every table has power points for plugging in your laptop and other gadgets.

The cafe is run by some people who started an online forum in Vietnam calledÂ <a href="http://tinhte.com" target="_blank">tinhte.com</a>. They started the cafe after the forum became popular and they wanted a place for people to hang out. You can see a lot of gadgets being unboxed here for reviews or pictures and a lot of freelancers working on their stuff. The staff is really friendly and you can hang out here all day. In fact, if you come here for a few days, you will start running into the same people. Its like a virtual office. Checkout the video of the place below

This cafe and the online operation is what would be termed a lifestyle business. Basically they are not looking at growing or opening more cafes or maximizing profits from this cafe. They wanna create a friendly environment for people to hang out and work and in the process keep the entire operation profitable. In some ways, being a lifestyle business gives this place its friendly touch and character.

I think we need a lot more lifestyle businesses like this. We need more friendly places and businesses that don't put profits before customer service and customer happniess.
