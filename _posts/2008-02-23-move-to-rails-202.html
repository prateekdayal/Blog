I finally moved <a href="http://muziboo.com">Muziboo</a> to rails 2.0.2 this weekend. The move went pretty smooth. The only gotcha for me was that counters used with conter_cache  are marked as readonly in rails 2.0.2 so you cannot use update_attributes to update them (in a migration or otherwise)

The trick is to use Class.update_counters class method ...

Other than that most of the things you need to know are well documented on the web .. this one took me almost a day to figure out so I am mentioning it on the blog

The move to rails 2.0.2 was motivated by the fact that I see all the new plugins and blog posts talking about rails 2 and so I did not want to miss out on all the new action and possibly other security updates  etc
