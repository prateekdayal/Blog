Last couple of months I have been extremely busy with Muziboo work, attending conferences like TES and PAN IIT and also doing some bit  of consulting work.  I therefore could not blog all that much. However I now plan to get back to regular blogging and blog atleast a couple of times a month.

However in the true spirit of Web 2.0, I would like to get some feedback and know what people like reading on my blog (since I have about 50 subscribers in feedburner, I am taking the liberty of assuming readership).  I have always believed that since Muziboo is still not huge there would not be enough interest in knowing a lot about it (esp. non tech aspects).  However lately some people I met told me that they would like to know some more about what we do and why we do it. I would therefore like to ask you all this question. What would you like to read here :)
