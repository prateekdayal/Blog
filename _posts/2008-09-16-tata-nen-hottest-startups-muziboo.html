A couple of weeks back I wrote a rant about <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/blog/2008/08/28/a-rant-about-nen-hottest-startups-and-radioverve-part-1/">Radioverve</a> and Tata NEN hottest startups award. A few days after that, our nomination went live on the website. A couple of days after that, Yusuf Motiwala of TringMe wrote a post about <a href="http://blog.motiwala.com/2008/09/12/nen-forcibly-nominating-startup-why">NEN forcibly nominating startups</a>. In his email to NEN, he wrote that he does not understand the rationale for a contest where contestants are introduced in chunks and the website has no information about the pending contenstants. He has a very valid point and I completely agree with him. A few days after Yusuf's objections, NEN setup three email addresses, one of which can be used to withdraw notimations. We wrote to them and got a confirmation today that our nomination has been withdrawn. So as of this moment, we are officially not part of that joke.
