Just found out this awesome tool called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1730">scribfire</a> which lets you add blog posts using firefox and I am making this post using it!<br /><br />Lately I have been trying out more firefox plugins that help me minimize context switch while working and so far I have found twitter fox quite helpful. Ofcourse its helpful only with notifications turned off. With notifications turned on, its an even bigger distraction :)<br /><br />What plugins do you use to minimize context switches? <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=93d1fa52-e40c-4346-a03c-bfa7bf4914db" /></div>
