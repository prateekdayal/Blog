I have decided to take a break from startup related blogging and review a few gadgets that I bought in the recent past (and some services I used in last few months). Enjoy the posts.

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The first one is a review of the <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/devices/nokia-5800-xpressmusic" target="_blank">Nokia 5800 xpress music phone</a> that I got in August. I had an imate (windows mobile) phone before and though it had some good features, it had a very tough interface and wasn't very usable. Also, I was not very happy with the build quality and spent a lot of time gluing the parts together every time it fell down.  Apart from decent build quality, this time I wanted to buy a phone which had the following features </span>
<ul>
	<li>Wi-fi, Email and a decent web browser (atleast usable enough to login to some web consoles and perform admin tasks for <a href="http://www.muziboo.com" target="_blank">Muziboo</a> in case of an emergency)</li>
	<li>A usable music player with decent headphones  (I generally look for good bass)</li>
</ul>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> I wanted to upgrade to an iphone but found it to be damn expensive (in India and US). I then ran into some reviews of 5800 and decided to buy it as it offered great features for its price. Since there are a lot of detailed spec reviews of 5800 on the net, I will just post what I personally liked and disliked after using the phone for a couple of months</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>The Good</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>Wi-fi is very easy to setup and works great. You can easily select if you want to connect to Wi-Fi/ GPRS everytime an applications wants to access internet. The web browser is also pretty usable and supports Javascript (and more importantly flash)</li>
	<li>Comes with a 8 GB memory card (upto 16 GB supported)  so you can load hundreds of songs on it. It has a pretty decent music player and the video playback is great too. The bundled headphones are good quality and it supports a standard 3.5mm phone jack so you can use better desktop headphones too. The headphones come with controls for next/previous/stop/play/pause and volume so its very easy to change tracks while you are on a treadmill. It also comes with lots of preloaded music (both Hindi and English).</li>
	<li>There are some pretty useful apps available for symbian (such as <a href="http://s2putty.sourceforge.net/">putty</a>)</li>
	<li>There is a 3.0 megapixel camera that takes decent pics. Not as great as a cybershot phone camera but good enough to capture memories. You can see a pic I took <a href="http://twitpic.com/gj6q7" target="_blank">here</a></li>
	<li>It has a pretty big screen (bigger than iphone screen)</li>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Comes with maps and GPS (3 months free trial)</span></li>
	<li>Its currently priced at 13.5k so its pretty cheap (I got it for around 16.5k). strongly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.offersforshoppers.com/NewOFS/offersDetail.php/503/buy-Nokia-5800-XpressMusic-Mobile-Banashankari-Bangalore">offersforshoppers.com for 5800's coupons</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>The Bad</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Does not charge through a USB cable. You need to carry the stupid Nokia charger. I find this pretty irritating</li>
	<li>The touchpad is not as good as that of an iPhone (However its still pretty usable)</li>
	<li>There are not as many apps available for 5800. iPhone clearly is a winner here</li>
</ul>
Overall I find the phone good value for money. Let me know if you have any questions.
