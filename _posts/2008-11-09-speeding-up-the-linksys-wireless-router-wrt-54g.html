We haveÂ  a BSNL Dataone connection and a linksys wireless router for internet sharing and LAN. However lately the router had been extremely slow and would hang somtimes, forcing us to reboot it every now and then. I installed the DD-WRT firmware on it but that did not help much either (although it helped in several other ways, one being using the access point as a wifi client and not an access point). Recently <a href="http://geekmokhsa.blogspot.com">Prasanna</a> told me about a problem with the router while using bit torrent which can be fixed with some settings in DD-WRT. Turns out that bit torrents open up a lot of network connections and that loads the non-enterprise routers (like WRT 54G) and hangs them up.

There is a way to fix it listed on the <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Router_Slowdown">DD-WRT wiki</a> and it worked in first go. The router has been behaving pretty well since then and there is a noticable difference in the network speed and responsiveness. If you are facing an issue too, do try it out.
