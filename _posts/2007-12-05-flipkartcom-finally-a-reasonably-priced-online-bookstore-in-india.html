I recently came across  <a href="http://flipkart.com">flipkart.com</a>, an online bookstore which as far as i know is the only online bookstore in India to offer discounts and free shipping (with no catch). I have not ordered from them yet as I already have a pile of books i very recently got and have not read yet but their collection looks good. Almost all volumes have discount and some even have upto 20% discount.

Their UI is refreshingly simple and the search is quite powerful which I think is very important for a website like this. Since they are only a month old, they do not have too many fancy features but I had a chat with the team and they are in the process of adding a lot of nice features. They however have must have features like "Search history" etc. They accept all major credit cards and are working on adding more payment gateways.

If you are considering buying a book in the near future, I would highly recommend using their services. Do let me know how was your experience.

Here is wishing the founding team best of luck for success!
