I have written about <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/blog/2008/06/07/why-are-you-doing-a-startup/">why do a startup</a> and also about <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/blog/2008/03/21/life-in-the-garage-part-1/">life in the garage</a> and both the posts have a recognizable negative tone. However startups are pretty interesting and generally a great learning experience. I therefore thought of writing a post on what doing a startup can teach you that you cannot easily learn otherwise. Not in a similar timeframe atleast.

So here is a list of ten things I feel a startup can teach you (in no particular order).
<ol>
	<li>Discipline and time management</li>
	<li>Taking complete responsibility for your actions</li>
	<li>Value and power of money (especially if you are bootstrapping)</li>
	<li>How to build a great network and make it work for you</li>
	<li>Wearing multiple hats with reasonable success</li>
	<li>Great Technical learning</li>
	<li>'I <strong>have</strong> to do this' attitude instead of 'Can I do this?' or 'Should I do this?'</li>
	<li>Great writing skills (Blog, emails, newsletters)</li>
	<li>Working in constraints (design, technology, marketing budget)</li>
	<li>An eye for useful stuff, trends and opportunities (reading blogs, docs, logs, listening to people ... whatever)</li>
</ol>
Disclaimer: In no way am I implying that I am a master of the everything mentioned above :) I am just saying that a year or more into a startup, you would have improved in a lot of these areas.
