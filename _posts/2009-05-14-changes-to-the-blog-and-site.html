I have recently made some changes to the blog and my site. I have moved my blog from <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/blog">prateekdayal.net/blog</a> to <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/">prateekdayal.net</a>. I had plans of making a real website but I finally accepted that I will never have the time or motivation to do so. I have also installed a new (less jazzier) theme. Even though, I have redirected the links, due to the move, some of the of images be broken. If you find something, just drop me a line or add a comment and I will fix it. <br /><br />I had already moved my techblog to <a href="http://devblog.muziboo.com">muziboo dev blog</a> so there is no more a tech tab in the navigation menu. Since I use feedburner (who doesn't?), the feeds should not be affected.<br />
