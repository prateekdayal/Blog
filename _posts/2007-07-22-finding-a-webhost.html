<p class="storycontent">Hi,</p>
So this is my another new blog <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://blog.prateekdayal.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />

Last one month or so has been a lot of experimentation in terms of webhosts. I tried godaddy.com, dreamhost and hostingrails.com. Here is my take on all of them. Again this is just a personal viewpoint and may/may not apply to other people. Depends what you are looking for. In general I feel there are lots of hosts and one can always find out what they are looking for. It however helps to know for sure what you are looking for (lots of webspace vs speed vs support for some language/platform and ofcourse how much you are willing to spend)

They I think are one of the big players however I found it very surprising that they do not give shell access in any of their shared hosting plans. This may be of importance to a lot of people, so be sure. In terms of speed etc, they are fine. Also I think they are good for domain registrations etc. I got a domain for $7.17 or something through them. Like other hosts, they do give you a lot of softwares that can be installed by a single click

<a title="Dreamhost.com" href="http://dreamhost.com/" target="_blank">Dreamhost:</a>

These guys are quite big too and for the money that you pay, you cannot find more space and more bandwidth easily anywhere else. They give shell access and have a great control panel but the only drawback may be (again applies to only few) that their rubyonrails support is not very great. You can upgrade plans only in terms of space/bw but you cannot add on more memory etc to your account (to run a mongreal instance for example)

<a href="http://hostingrails.com/">HostingRails:</a>

Hostingrails is pretty good for <a title="Ruby On Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> hosting. They have good set of documentation on how to get your rails application online (existing or new) and also how to debug a lot of issues. Their support knows rails well and you can find that out by glancing over their forums. However you may not get as much space/bw as you get with dreamhost. One thing i do like is that you can upgrade plans and also get more static memory for your account. So this may be useful if you want to run mongrel or other applications that require more RAM. Also its pretty easy to upgrade your plans and they can even help you upgrade to a dedicated server when you want. They say that they can get you online within 24 hours even when you move to a dedicated server.

Lot of the above information is what I found out reading their docs and forums and may not be correct/not stay correct. Please do let me know your comments and I will update the article.

PS: I am  currently with hostingrails.com where I am hosting my new internet venture <a title="Muziboo.com" href="http://muziboo.com/" target="_blank">Muziboo.com</a>. I plan to finish all the basic functionality in a month may be. Do check it out and let me know what you feel. You can read <a title="Muziboo Blog" href="http://blog.muziboo.com/" target="_blank">Muziboo Blog</a> to know more about what we are trying to achieve there.
