Last few days have been lot of fun. I tried out <a href="http://icecast.org">icecast</a> that lets you run your own online radio station and here you have a beta version of <a href="http://muziboo.com:8000">Muziboo Radio</a>. Currently there are three streams, English, Hindi and Instrumentals and as we find more content (rather as more content is uploaded to <a href="http://muziboo.com">Muziboo</a>), we will be adding more channels.&nbsp; We found out that 30 songs is a good number to start off a radio stream. So the next one we would like to see is a classical channel. 

I would be writing about how to run an icecast service and integrate it with your ruby on rails website in the next couple of posts. I am just thinking if I really should separate my personal and technical blog or keep it together. 

Its been a lot of fun integrating icecast and Muziboo.com. The link for the radio above is default icecast page. In about a week's time, there will be a <a href="http://muziboo.com/radio">Muziboo Radio Page</a> that will have lots of cool stuff. It will be mostly this integration that I plan to talk about.

Also like most Muziboo services, radio also will be embeddable everywhere. We plan to make almost all of muziboo content embeddable on blogs, social networks etc so that our users don't have to fight hard to spread their content. 

Try listening to the streams for now .. you will need winamp, xmms or media player to do that .. but believe me .. worth the effort .. my current favorite is Instrumentals
