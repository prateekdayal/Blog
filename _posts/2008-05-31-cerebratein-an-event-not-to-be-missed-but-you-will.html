And not just once. Year after year you will miss this event :)

I met a fellow blogger today and we were talking about the big bloggers of India and <a href="http://kiruba.com/">Kiruba Shankar's</a> name came up in the discussion. I had not visited his blog in a long time and decided to take a look. I found this interesting post on <a href="http://cerebrate.in">Cerebrate.in</a>. The <a href="http://www.kiruba.com/2008/05/cerebrate-event.html">post</a> describes the concept behind cerebrate.in

<em>"In simple terms, it's getting the very best minds from different fields together for three days of togetherness, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">ideating</span> and sharing knowledge. These are folks from Law, Movies, Technology, Theatre, Sports, Management, Photography, Medicine, Journalism, Music.... The only connecting factor amongst the lot is the excellence. These are folks who are driven and have achieved in their own chosen fields." </em>

On some googling, I also found this interesting video about it

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mgdV7QGRG_Y&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mgdV7QGRG_Y&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>

So basically cerebrate is a get together of the elite crowd who meet in a great resort (the primary sponsor of the event), drink, eat and ideate. What I am surprised at is that I have never ever met any of <a href="http://cerebrate.in/who.html">these </a>people at <a href="http://barcampbangalore.org">Barcamp Bangalore</a>. Considering this event was in Goa, I am sure travel is not a problem. So Is Barcamps for commoners only? I never see the venture funded startups or the celebrity bloggers (leaving out the few exceptions) there. I tried to find out about the discussions in cerebrate but unfortunately, the <a href="http://cerebrate.in/blog/">blog </a>and <a href="http://cerebrate.in/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">wiki</a> of cerebrate have not been updated with the details. All the discussions there are  private knowledge not shared with the commoners yet.

I read some days back about how there is a FooCamp and then people who were not invited <a href="http://news.cnet.com/Geeks-to-hold-open-source-campout/2100-1041_3-5839680.html">created </a>barcamp. I am surprised that cerebrate is an effort to go from Barcamps to FooCamps. Also some of the people attending/organizing cerebrate are advocates of free knowledge and democratization of everything. The video also looks more like a commercial for Club Mahindra (as some people note in the <a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3217734&amp;postID=8523023178137553861">comments</a> to the original post), especially towards the end. In fact I read on <a href="http://www.enidhi.net/2008/04/club-mahindra-to-host-celebrate-in.html">this</a> blog post that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Kiruba</span> Arun (according to a comment, its Arun and not Kiruba) had also participated in Club Mahindra's Annual Sales Summit sometime back. May be I am just plain jealous that I could not and would never be able to sit with the best minds of the country and get to discuss stuff with them. I can email them but then I doubt if I would ever get a reply. I swear, I have tried it with a few of them in the past :)

I guess I better wait for BCB 7 :(
