The post should be called my ruby on rails learning curve. I just wanted to write about what it was for a person like me to learn ruby on rails and get productive in it and make something like <a href="http://muziboo.com">Muziboo.com</a>

I was introduced to rails by a cousin of mine when I was trying to decide the technology for muziboo. I was intially inclined to use turbogears as I knew a lil bit of python. I had used zope+plone before but I could never really get a grip on that whole system. Once I saw the ruby on rails <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/screencasts">screencasts</a>, I got really excited and went ahead and tried the book Agile Web Development with Rails.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Web-Development-Rails-Programmers/dp/097669400X"><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PP6SQ89CL._AA240_.jpg" title="Agile web development" alt="Agile web development" align="left" height="240" width="240" /></a> I found this book to be pretty good for beginners. I coded almost the entire "depot" application that they walk you through in thi book and it really gave me a good knowledge of how basically rails works. I started coding up <a href="http://muziboo.com">Muziboo</a> right after this.

After a couple of weeks when I had more specific problem or was looking for some specific information (such as implementing a forum etc), I looked at the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Ruby-Rails-E-Commerce-Professional/dp/1590597362">Beginning Ruby on Rails Ecommerce</a> which I found to be an excellent read too.

One more thing which really helped me was the amount of tutorial available online on ruby on rails and in particular the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a> with Ryan series. For any non-caboose developing in rails, I feel you must subscribe to his feed and check out the videos. I think he posts twice or thrice every week.

When you actually get down to coding, the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/">ruby on rails API</a> is simply irreplaceable. Whatever you are doing, be it activerecords (and specially that) or controllers or anything, do take a look at this. You will find that there are so many things (as in options, methods) other than the most popular ones that you help you achieve a lot. I have never found anything better atleast when it comes to activerecords than the API.

<a href="http://www.manning.com/black/"><img src="http://www.manning.com/black/black_cover150.jpg" height="187" width="150" /></a> I am currently reading <a href="http://www.manning.com/black/">Ruby for Rails</a> on the recommendation of <a href="http://www.igvita.com/blog">Illya</a> who by the way has a great blog and is again a must subscribe to kinds. I am somehow not finding much time to read this book but so far it has been like an eye opener. If you ever wondered why Ruby 'on' Rails and not Ruby 'on' 'something-else', you must read this book

This is what I have done to get enough knowledge to be able to code and run <a href="http://muziboo.com">Muziboo.com</a>. I will update this post with more information as and when I find something . Please do leave your comments and let me know other useful resources.
