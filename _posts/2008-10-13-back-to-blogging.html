I recently switched from apache to <a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> as my webserver and since then my blog's admin section was inaccessible. I have finally been able to crack it today and hence this quick post to celebrate :)

I think nginx rocks in general and I will soon write a more detailed post about nginx and the move including all the problems I faced on my <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/tech">tech</a> blog.
