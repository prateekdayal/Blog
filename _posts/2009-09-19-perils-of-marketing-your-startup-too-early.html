Soon after we launched Muziboo in Aug 2007, we started talking to our friends and family about it. We also talked to a lot of people in barcamp and other startup events. The discussions always led to marketing ideas for Muziboo. Most people advised us to not get too much into technology and focus on marketing. This made us believe that there are two components in  doing a web startup
<ol>
	<li>Product Development</li>
	<li>Marketing</li>
</ol>
Marketing is conventionally considered as printing posters, going to music festivals (or trade shows if you are in that sorta business), talking to students in colleges (if you are addressing the youth market) etc. Product development is adding features to your website. In general people look at these as non overlapping activities. However, as we discovered over time, there are some issues with this approach

<strong>Sending the wrong marketing message</strong>

Unless you are starting up in a field where you have solid domain experience, you will most likely refine your offering in the first few months of the startup, based on customer feedback. In fact thats the whole benefit of releasing early and often. By interacting with your early adopters, you will understand the problems they are facing better and change the product to solve those problems. However, if you go out aggressively to market your startup early on and later change your vision, you will have a hard time fixing the image people have in their head.

In case of Muziboo, when we started out, we believed that our market is only the amateur crowd .....

<strong>Improving the product <em>is</em> marketing</strong>

For Internet startups, product development is marketing. A better product makes people happy and makes them pay and become evangelists. However its very easy to overlook this and believe otherwise. Its easy to look at a product as a bunch of features thrown together that need to be marketed. In fact beyond coding up features, there is a lot of work that can improve adoption -  usability, making the back-end faster and more intelligent recommendations etc.
