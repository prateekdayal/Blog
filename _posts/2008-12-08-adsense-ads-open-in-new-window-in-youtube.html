One of the feature that most people find missing in <a href="http://google.com/adsense" target="_blank">adsense</a> is the ability to open google adsense ads in a new window (on click). This would help publishers make revenues without losing their visitors. However <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=48182" target="_blank">adsense terms and conditions</a> document clearly prohibits that. In particular it says

<em>Any AdSense code must be pasted directly into webpages without modification. AdSense participants are not allowed to alter any portion of the code or change the behavior, targeting, or delivery of ads. For instance, clicks on Google ads may not result in a new browser window being launched. </em>

However youtube gets special treatment there. Ads in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/community" target="_blank">youtube's community page</a> (and several others open in new window) and there is in fact a small image right next to the 'Ads by Google' logo indicating that. Here is a screenshot

<a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/youtube.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-115" title="Adsense in Youtube" src="http://www.prateekdayal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/youtube.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="394" /></a>

I am wondering why youtube should get this special treatment. If this format works better for youtube (and for users) then shouldn't other sites be allowed this too?
