Airtel Mobile Office basically helps you connect your mobile to laptop and browse the internet. They have two plans, one for Rs 20 a day and other for Rs 99 a week with unlimited browsing in both plans. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and here are the pros and cons

<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Browsing speed is ok. Like old dial up days. You cannot stream media but pretty much browse other stuff</li>
	<li>Works on roaming pretty much across India. I could browse in the train too most times.</li>
	<li>Its not all that expensive given the daily and weekly price and if you compare it with other data cards available in the market</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The daily plan stops working at 10 AM the next day no matter when you activate it the previous day.</li>
	<li>I once activated the weekly pack and I was charged but the pack never worked. On calling the customer care (at STD rates from Delhi) they told me to activate daily pack.Â  Effectively I lost around 100 bucks</li>
	<li>The customer service sucks. Don't expect them to be able to help you with anything at all</li>
</ul>
I think the cons are not really specific to airtel. They are true with all big companies in India. The attitude is "screw you .. we will treat you whatever way we want and you can't do anything about it". Lately I have experienced it with a lot of companies and no matter how much we tweet or blog about our experience the big companies just don't give a shit about your experience.
