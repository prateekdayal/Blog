They say that third time's a charm. I am certainly hoping that they are true as I am about to embark on my third product startup, <a href="http://supportbee.com" target="_blank">SupportBee</a>. My first startup lasted about six months and I never really launched. My second startup, <a href="http://www.muziboo.com" target="_blank">Muziboo</a> launched and I worked fulltime on it for the last three years. SupportBee has been in the works for the last few months and its about time I talked to people about it :)

<strong>What is SupportBee?</strong>

SupportBee is a customer support and interaction tool. There are plenty of customer support softwares out there but none solves the correct problems. Right now, it's <em>really</em> hard to do awesome customer service. Typically founders at startups are very passionate about customer service and they put in a lot of effort in researching about their customers and replying to every query. However, as they bring more people into the organization, the quality of responses goes down. Also one should not have to work so hard to provide well researched and thought out responses. The ideal software would make it really easy for anyone to do great customer service by providing them with relevant data about the customer (among other things).  That's the direction we are taking with SupportBee. We'll help you delight your customers. You can read more on our <a href="http://supportbee.com/about">about us</a> page. Also, do subscribe to our <a href="http://blog.supportbee.com">blog</a>, where we will be publishing interviews with people passionate about customer service. The first to come up next week would be with <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2009/05/12/please-welcome-valerie-liberty-to-the-balsamiq-family/">Valarie of Balsamiq</a>

SupportBee is currently in closed beta as we work on improving the product with a handful of passionate customers. Please do <a href="http://supportbee.com/beta-signup">signup</a> and let us know if you have any ideas for the product or customer service in general.

<strong>The future of Muziboo </strong>

Muziboo has been a great learning experience and we are very proud of what we have accomplished. We have over 200,000 users from all over the world who have uploaded over 100,000 tracks to Muziboo. The service is profitable and is in fact the seed fund/test bed for SupportBee. Muziboo will continue to run with the same quality of service and customer support. Bugs will get fixed and new features rolled out as and when they make sense. In short, nothing changes there.

I hope to write more about the switch, Muziboo experience and related things sometime soon. If you have any specific questions, do let me know. Do <a href="http://supportbee.com/beta-signup">signup</a> for SupportBee beta and/or pass it on to people who are passionate about customer service and think that this is still not a solved problem. We would love to talk to you :)
