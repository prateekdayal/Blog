Everyone agrees that the hardest part for a startup is to get the early set of enthusiastic users. <a href="http://www.muziboo.com">We</a> got our first set of really enthusiastic users and evangelists from <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/2007/11/20/barcamp-bangalore-5-muziboocom-and-blogging-debate/">Barcamp Bangalore 5th edition</a> (BCB5). They gave us tons of good feedback, <a href="http://jerrymannel.com/blog/2007/11/23/muziboo-me-myself-and-my-music/">blogged</a> about us, turned into passionate <a href="http://www.muziboo.com/sandil">users</a> and got more <a href="http://www.muziboo.com/jocalling">passionate users</a>. Its not very hard to imagine why this happens. The thing about barcamps is that there are geeks there who are willing to listen to you simply because you have created something yourself. They don't care whether the whole world is using your service yet or not. If you have something cool and can convince them why its great, they are willing to try it out and even talk to other people or blog about it.  They may sometimes get attracted to your service simply because its built in Ruby on Rails (or their favorite framework) :)

However its very hard to travel to different cities or countries to attend such events and demo your startup and talk to the people about what you do. This is where I feel bootstrappers have a disadvantage compared to the well funded companies.  But we can easily fix this problem by having a Barcamper Exchange Program (lets call it that untill we find a better name) where we have a pool of barcampers who are willing to demo your app in their local barcamps. They won't do it for the money or as a favour but simply because they are in the same boat and know how hard it is to get the word out there.

In fact such a thing is not too hard to execute. One can simply create a group on linkedin where all the upcoming barcamps can be listed. Startup founders can join the group and show their interest in being demoed at a particular barcamp and tell which barcamps they can demo someone else's startup. If there is good matche in interest/geography etc, the founders can take if offline and demo each others startups.  It may require some tweaking but you get the idea.

However as wise men say, ideas are worthless. However I wanted to post this on my blog and see what people feel about it. If there is enough interest, we can go ahead and create the linkedin group and take this forward!
