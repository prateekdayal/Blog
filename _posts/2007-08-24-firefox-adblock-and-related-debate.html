I read a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/23/why-darwin-beats-danny-carlton/">post</a> today on techcrunch about Danny Carlton who has blocked all users of firefox from accessing his blog. Readers from firefox are redirected to <a href="http://whyfirefoxisblocked.com/index1.php">why firefox is blocked</a> page. The reason is that firefox is endorsing the adblock plugin which blocks the ads but does not let the website owners block users who have blocked the ads. So Danny blocks entire firefox.

I think he makes a valid point. Adsense is the only revenue source to lot of publishers. That is the reason why so many publishers are surviving or making money. I see nothing 'wrong' in putting ads. Some people may say that ads kill the aesthetics of the website. I feel in that case, it is your duty to let the website owner know that or if you think that the site is so despicable, not visiting it. However if you like the content but visit it and block the ads, I feel that is ethically wrong. Its like "I want things my way".

I also find it very funny that google adsense has listed firefox as one of the referral product and firefox is supporting the adblock extension. Does someone else find it ironical too ?

Please do not block ads ... let people make some revenue and focus on serving you content and not worry about making a business plan or paying the hosting bills ..
