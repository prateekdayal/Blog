I had written sometime back about why <a href="http://prateekdayal.net/blog/2008/04/16/why-shared-hosting-is-bad-for-your-startup/">shared hosting is bad</a> for your startup and recommended VPS hosting for any serious web venture. Today, as promised in that post, I am writing a review of <a href="http://vpsfarm.com">VPSFarm.com</a>. VPSFarm is based out of US and while researching for VPS provieders, I found them to be pretty good. I considered slicehost and other popular VPS choices as well as some cheap dedicated boxes from layeredtech.com etc. This is what I did not like about them
<ul>
	<li>Most VPS providers take some time to setup your VPS. This should be mostly fine but there is a delay nevertheless</li>
	<li>Providers like Slicehost etc have a waiting time before you can get your VPS. I think after signing up, it took a few weeks before I got an email.</li>
	<li>Cheap dedicated boxes have older processors which may be ok for you but I was not so sure about that. Another thing is that they have a regular hard drive and no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks">RAID</a> protection. Even with backups, I think its good to have RAID so that your server does not go down with a drive failure.</li>
	<li>I found the RAM being offered everywhere else to be almost half for the same price.</li>
</ul>

I did not find many reviews of VPSFarm when I was trying to signup and I already had not so great experience with two providers before so I was a little concerned. However I went through their docs online and finally ordered. Somethings that I really liked about them then were
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #000000;">Xen based Virtual Private Servers (from my research I found out that xen is the preferred way)</span></li>
	<li>No setup time or fees or annual contracts (pay every month by paypal)</li>
	<li>Choice of operating systems (I picked debian as ubuntu was and is still missing)</li>
	<li>You can install/reboot/halt VPS using a web based control panel</li>
	<li>Bandwidth is unmetered (speed depends on your plan) and RAM/price ratio is awesome</li>
	<li>RAID 10 for storage</li>
</ul>
Something that may be of concern to some people are
<ul>
	<li>Only one IP address assigned. As far as I know, you cannot currently buy more. This is ok in general but not good  if you want to host DNS. I however recommend <a href="http://prateekdayal.net/blog/2008/04/15/how-to-outsource-on-small-budget/">outsourcing</a> DNS and emai.</li>
	<li>Its not possible to move to a higher or lower plan without some kind of downtime or manually setting up the new VPS. If you are ok with downtime however, they would help you move.</li>
</ul>
So far (last 8 months) my experience with VPSFarm has been awesome. Only once my VPS went down for some 20 minutes but I got an email from them immediately and the issue was fixed. There was once a network outage but it was automatically restored in a minute.  I started out with XEN 1024 plan and I am currently on XEN 2048 plan.
