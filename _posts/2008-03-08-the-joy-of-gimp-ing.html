I have to accept it .. rather I always accept it that I am no great designer .. for that matter am not even an ace coder. I am more of a guy who can get things done ... 

Ok anyways, coming back to design, I started learning this cool thing called <a href="http://openlaszlo.org">openlaszlo</a> a few months back and made a couple of widgets using it for <a href="http://muziboo.com">Muziboo</a>. I never released any of them because I pretty much such at doing a skin. However lately, working with Vinod at <a href="http://elinanetworks.com">Elina Networks</a>, I learnt a thing or two about photoshop, layers, basic color manipulation etc etc. I tried to apply some of them on gimp and came up with a skin for the new radio client I had been working on this week. 

Man I am excited ... it may not be the best design or something, but its just so much joy to skin your product and then put it on your <a href="http://prateekdayal.blogspot.com">blog</a> (only on old blogspot blog right now). Take a look at it and also checkout some of the cool music from Muziboo. If you want my personal recommendation, try out the instrumental channel.
