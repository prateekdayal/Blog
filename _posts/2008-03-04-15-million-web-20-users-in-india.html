The article titled <a href="http://www.alootechie.net/lead/web-20-start-ups-together-have-15-lakh-users-in-india-idc/">Web 2.0 start-ups together have 15 lakh users in India: IDC</a> at <a href="alootechie.net">AlooTechie</a> is a great read. What it basically says is <em>"According to a study by IDC, India-focused Web 2.0 start-ups such as MingleBox, Fropper, SirfDosti and BigAdda have a combined user base of around 15 lakh users in the country, after eliminating overlaps."</em>

Now someone please tell me how these sites have millions of users. How do companies like IBibo justify that they had <a href="http://www.contentsutra.com/entry/419-ibibo-ceo-ashish-kashyap-on-tv-show-isuperstar-and-marketing-strategy/">1 million users when they went ahead and started advertising </a> and the signups have tripled since then. Where are all these people. Why don't I ever meet anyone who gives me a minglebox or ibibo url for their blogs or pictures ?

Am I missing something?
