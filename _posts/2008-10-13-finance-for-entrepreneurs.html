I recently attended the Finance for Entrepreneurs course offered by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nsrcel.org/home/">NSRCEL</a> of IIM Bangalore. The course description can be found in this <a href="http://www.nsrcel.org/Jayadev.doc">doc</a> file. The 2 day course costs 6K Rs which includes course fees, food (tea, lunch, snacks for both days) and a <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/finance-sense-easy-guide-non/0074600788-0mw3fy9v0c">finance book</a>. The course instructor is <a href="http://www.iimb.ernet.in/iimb/html/facultyprofile.jsp?id=157">Prof Jayadev
</a>

This is the first non engineering course that I have done and in fact the first classroom course I have done after IIT Guwahati so it was quite an interesting experience for me. I had zero finance knowledge before the course and it gave me a good sense of how things like balance sheets, profit analysis, product costing, working capital management etc works. There was a booklet with lot of case studies and given to us on the first day and pretty much all concepts were explained with an example from the booklet. The last few examples included the use of excel (such as 5 year plan for a project to do feasibility study).

I think its a good course for entrepreneurs to attend, especially if you are from a non finance background. Besides the course material, it was a good networking opportunity as the participants were from different industries including food and travel!
