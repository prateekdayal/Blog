Dear HSBC Credit Card Division,

While I appreciate your attempt to flatter and impress the platinum card holders, I would request you to stop printing those fat booklets that you send with each card. In fact if you can't do that, atleast don't reprint the same garbage and send it with add on cards. If you recommend people to go for eStatement, then you should also send them just a one page summary of benefits with a web link when you send them new cards. 

In the interest of our dying planet, please consider this. You can donate the money you save in printing costs to <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/">Green Peace</a>
