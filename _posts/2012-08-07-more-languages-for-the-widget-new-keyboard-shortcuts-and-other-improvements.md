Dear Bee Lovers,

We are very excited to show you some new features that we have rolled out over the last couple of weeks.

<strong>Translation for Widget</strong>

Thanks to our customers' help, we have added some more languages for the   contact support widget that you can choose from. To select the language of the  <a title="Help - Widget" href="http://help.supportbee.com/web-widget/" target="_blank">widget</a>, please go to <em>Admin</em>, then select <em>Widget</em>. If you can help us translate the widget into more languages, do send us a note.

<strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong>

At SupportBee, we have thought a lot about helping our customers manage and reply to tickets as fast as possible. Mastering keyboard shortcuts is one of the keys to getting stuff done quickly. You can now see a list of all keyboard shortcuts in the app by pressing ? key (or Shift + /). We also added new shortcuts for New Ticket (Shift + n) and moving focus to comments' box (c). You can always check out the entire list on the  <a href="http://help.supportbee.com/keyboard-shortcuts/" target="_blank">help page</a>.

<strong>Hide/Show Copied Users</strong>

Before, if the original ticket or replies has other people copied in the email,   you would see a long list of faces and names. No more! To show the copied users, just click on the link next to the replier's name. Click on it one more time to hide it. Simple as that!

<strong>Auto-disable Images</strong>

By default, SupportBee will hide images embedded in the tickets to protect your privacy. If you trust the sender, you can show the images by clicking on the icon on the right of the ticket's header.
