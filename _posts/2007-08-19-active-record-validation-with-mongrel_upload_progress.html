The active record validation is finally working with mongrel_upload_progress ... yayee. To read more about what the issue was, follow <a href="http://prateekdayal.net/blog/?p=5">this post</a>

I will try to explain my setup and then the solution to the problem

I am trying to watch /song/upload with mongrel_upload_progress plugin. Inside /song/upload, I save the song if the validation passes (such as file size, title present etc) otherwise I want to display some errors on the upload page. The problem is that since the page is not reloaded, the  <code> &lt;%=error_messages_for :song %&gt; </code>  does not work.

I employed a simple solution to fix this. I put <code> &lt;%= error_messages_for :song %&gt;  </code> in a div like this

<code>  &lt;div id="err_msg" &gt;&lt;%="error_messages_for"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>

and in the song_controller/upload method, if the validation fails, I do the following

<code>
responds_to_parent do # execute the redirect in the main window
  render :update do |page|
    page[:err_msg].replace_html(error_messages_for("song"))
  end
end
</code>

This displays the error messages for the upload even without the page being refreshed.
