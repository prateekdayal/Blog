<a rel="nofollow" href="http://mginger.com">mGinger</a> is a <a href="http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2007/11/indian_mobile_a_1.html">well funded</a> startup ($2M) that helps you in freeing up your mobile bills and get exciting deals in on your mobile. From what I understand, they basically pay you to receive ads on your mobile. Whether this is a neat idea or not is debatable and we will debate it later. What has really infuriated me is the fact that mGinger is actually spamming people by email to join their service. So they are basically trying to build a spam free mobile solution (you need to opt in to get ads) and spreading it by email spamming. Quite ironical.

The great thing about their spam is that they are not spamming all that blindly. They have acquired some database of users and their connections (not sure from where) and their invitations look like invitations for friends. I have verified from people that they never sent such invitations. There cannot be a bigger proof than the fact that I got an invitation from a friend who passed away last month (I can prove this if needed). This has seriously infuriated me and I think mGinger is generating massive negative PR by doing so. If well funded startups in the mobile space pull such cheap tricks to spread, I am not sure where the whole bazillion dollar indian mobile market is headed.
