I recently got a new VPS account and it runs 64 bit Debain Etch (4.0). I installed rubyworks on it and the installation went pretty smooth. After that, I tried to move muziboo.com files to this server and a lot of error started happening in trying to get the app up.

First one was

<code>
muziboo@debian:~/muziboo/muz$ rake db:migrate
(in /home/muziboo/muziboo/muz)
rake aborted!
no such file to load -- hpricot
</code>

When I tried to install hpricot and that resulted in the following

<code>
muziboo@debian:~/muziboo/muz$ gem install hpricot
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (RuntimeError)
Unsupported architecture: x86_64
</code>

To get rid of this error, I downloaded the latest rubygems package from rubyforge and the gem command started working fine. However I ran into this error now

<code>
debian:~/Softwares/rubygems-0.9.4# gem install hpricot --source http://code.whytheluckystiff.net
Bulk updating Gem source index for: http://code.whytheluckystiff.net
Select which gem to install for your platform (x86_64-linux)
1. hpricot 0.6 (mswin32)
2. hpricot 0.6 (jruby)
3. hpricot 0.6 (ruby)
4. hpricot 0.6 (jruby)
5. hpricot 0.6 (mswin32)
6. hpricot 0.6 (ruby)
7. Skip this gem
8. Cancel installation

Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::Installer::ExtensionBuildError)
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

ruby extconf.rb install hpricot --source http://code.whytheluckystiff.net
extconf.rb:1:in `require': no such file to load -- mkmf (LoadError)
from extconf.rb:1

Gem files will remain installed in /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/hpricot-0.6 for inspection.
Results logged to /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/hpricot-0.6/ext/hpricot_scan/gem_make.out

I googled around a bit and then followed <a href="http://spew.whalespine.org/tech/linux/debian/mkmfrb-on-debian/">this</a> post and the error disappeared but I started getting a new error about gcc missing on the system (during native extensions building stage). I installed that with apt-get install gcc-* (doing just apt-get install gcc resulted in header files missing error message).   This time the native extensions were built properly and the gem was installed.

The next problem came with rmagick. I installed imagemagick and libmagick9-dev (to avoid getting a missing Magick-config error).

Once everything was working, I could run the app using mongrel_rails start but I could still not get it up in the rubyworks framework. I would always get a 500 error. I had symlinked /usr/rails to my app's directory.

After lots of tests and experiments, I found out that rubyworks runs the processes as user rails and therefore your app's directory should be writeable by user rails. I don't know what is a good way to do that but I tried to make rails the owner of the app's directory, the application started running all fine.

So these are some of the steps where i faced some problems and thought of writing about it. I hope someone will save some time because of this. If you do, please let me know :)
