Continuing the <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/2008/04/16/why-shared-hosting-is-bad-for-your-startup/">series</a> of <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/2008/05/13/hosting-review-vpsfarmcom/">posts</a> on hosting, I decided to review my current host. Unlike the previous providers that I used, <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/">Hetzner</a> has its datacenters in Germany. For some reason, hosts in Europe are a lot cheaper than hosts in US and Hetzner seems to be one of the cheaper ones even in Europe. However, unlike the saying goes, in case of Hetzner, you get a lot more than you pay for.

Hetzner offers pretty good hardware and bandwidth for the cost . For instance, for about EUR 69 (reduce 19% if you are not in Europe), you get 12 GB RAM, 2 x 1.5 TB HDD and 5TB bandwidth on a 100 Mbps link. Additional bandwidth is priced at EUR 15 per TB. You can checkout this server <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/eq6/">here</a>. Remote reboot is free (btw, you should always check for this before ordering any server anywhere).

I have been using Hetzner for over a year and I have never had a problem with them so far. I think once or twice, their network has been out for a few minutes but other than that the server has been up constantly. Hetzner runs around 30,000 servers in about 15 datacenters in Germany and they have a very reliable service and good support. Most of their website and all their emails are available in English as well as German. I have interacted with support quite a bit and they have always been able to reply well in English

If you are looking for cheap dedicated server and you have no problem hosting in Germany (which you should not in most cases), Hetzner is a great choice.
