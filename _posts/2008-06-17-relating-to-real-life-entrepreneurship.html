I had been thinking of writing this post  for a long time now but never really got around to writing it. Partly,  I wanted to know how some other people feel about this. I think it was  good to have a discussion with <a href="http://www.iimb.ernet.in/iimb/html/facultyprofile.jsp?id=169">Prof. Suresh</a> yesterday at IIM Bangalore  about these issues. So here it is finally :)

These days, Bangalore has atleast one  <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=bangalore+startup+event">entrepreneurship related event</a> every week. More often, there are more.  Some of these are conferences and some unconferences. Most events see  a large number of aspiring entrepreneurs and a few people who have already  taken the plunge. People who have been there and done that are always  in minority. Specially in the unconferences, most people are aspiring  entrepreneurs or people who are currently fighting it out to make it  big.

If you attend these events and pay some  attention, you can almost always catch words like amazon, google, youtube  in the discussions. You can often hear about how Google came in when  search was already a very competitive market and they revolutionized  everything. How they did not make any money for years but focussed on  building a great service and eventually reached great heights. People  often talk of how the founders of these startups had a vision and they  stuck to it untill they made it big. However for some reason the same  people find it very hard to relate to the entrepreneurs around them.  Entrepreneurs who are more or less like them, who worked with them before  and are now on their own, trying to figure things out.

I find this very ironical. I believe  there are somethings almost all entrepreneurs have in common. Some phases  in life almost every entrepreneur/startup has to go through. Talking  of the same phase in the context of successful startup inspires people  whereas a startup in the same phase (but not big yet) cannot find many  supporters (in the startup circle).

<strong>Confusion Rules a Startup</strong>

More often than not, people assume that  by definition, startups would have it all figured out and only then  founders would take a plunge. However if you zoom into the early life   of most successful startups, they too took some time to figure out things.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">Paypal</a> and Blogger are two great examples of startups who took sometime  before they finally knew what it is thats gonna make it big for them.  Things are never crystal clear right from the start. Zeroing in on something  that can become big and can be monetized takes some time. Even in the  context of an idea, there are several details that take time of figure  out. Most startups do their market research on the way. <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/">Founders at Work</a> is a great book to read to understand startups and entrepreneurs.

<strong>You don't start a million dollar company.  You grow yours into one</strong>

You can at best start a company. You  cannot start a million dollar company. Atleast not most times. You identify  a need, solve some problems and then scale it up. There are a lot of  startups who have grown this way (<a href="http://craigslist.org">Craigslist</a>, <a href="http://plentyoffish.com">PlentyofFish</a>, Blogger).  In fact there have been several companies in India too. The most popular  of the lot would certainly be Naukri.com. All these companies took time  to grow. Simply because you have not made a million dollar in the first  year or two does not mean you will not make it in the next five.

<strong>You will make mistakes</strong>

Making mistakes is inevitable. When you  are trying to do something new (again relative) and when there are no  references/guides available for every step you take, you will go wrong  often. Even the big companies have had failed products. Google had to  buy youtube despite having Google Videos. Apple has had failed products.  Several companies join the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/deadpool/">Techcrunch Deadpool</a> every month. Mistakes  are part of the whole startup experience. So if your next door startup  just threw away their last 3 months of work because it did not take  off the way they thought, don't write them off.

<strong>Marketing IS a problem</strong>

"But how will you market your idea?"  is a question I hear too often from the crowd in such events. Trust  me when I say that we are all trying to figure it out. I believe all  startups are finally an exercise in sales and marketing more than anything.  So the companies that figure it out are gonna make it big and you know  how long it takes to make it big.  So don't expect to hear in a  few lines the answer to this question. Marketing is an ongoing process.  Everyone is new in internet marketing. We all know how romantic social  media is but very few of us have had a chance to go out with it yet.

<strong>Monetization takes time</strong>

Most companies put monetization last.  I think its fair enough considering that no real monetization can happen  unless you grow to a critical mass. Since every startup (atleast the  bootstrapping ones) have very limited bandwidth, founders prefer to  put that into marketing and gaining that critical mass rather than monetizing  early on. Give these guys sometime.  Google could monetize only  after a few years. Facebook and Orkut are still trying to figure it  out. Would you write them off?

<strong>Its not all romantic</strong>

Startups take time and this is doubly  true in India, where internet has still not reached every corner of  the country. There are not gonna be many quick exits. Most people would  have to stick to their ideas for reasonably long and not everything  they do during that phase is gonna look romantic. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666">The Dip</a> is gonna take  over sooner than later and only perseverance would get startups out  of it. During the dip, romantic is the last thing a startup is. However  once out of the dip, that phase and the story of how founders could  pull the startup out of it looks very romantic. So next time you meet  a guy who has been trying to get to the next level for the last one  year, don't write off his startup. If you are concerned, try to analyze  his bottlenecks and see if you or your contacts can help.

This post is not about not questioning  a startup. Its about taking the right lessons from the successful (or  failed) startups and then looking at startups around you in the light  of that knowledge. If we want to develop  a true ecosystem, we  must begin to understand the startups well first. We must understand  that they are different from big companies, they have different needs  and different priorities. Thats what makes entrepreneurship so differnet  and hence fun :)
