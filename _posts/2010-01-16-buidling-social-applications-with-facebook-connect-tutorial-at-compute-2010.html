<em>Facebook Connect is a powerful set of APIs for developers that lets users bring their identity and connections everywhere. - <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect Page</a> at Facebook Developer site</em>

In simple terms, Facebook Connect lets you provide a 'Login with Facebook' functionality on your website. Once users login with their Facebook credentials, you can help them post the activity they perform on your website back as news feeds on Facebook. You can see Facebook Connect in action at <a href="http://www.muziboo.com">Muziboo</a>. In fact, our implementation was the winner in <a href="http://www.facebook.com/posted.php?id=171942265482&amp;share_id=158988898951&amp;comments=1#s158988898951">Facbook Developer Contest India</a>.

If you want to implement FB Connect on your site, there are plugins available for some <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Facebook_Connect_Plugin_Directory">blogging tools and popular CMS</a> packages. However, if you have your own platform, you need to use their Javascript library to integrate the functionality. I will be doing a <a href="http://compute.acmbangalore.org/tutorial.html">hands on tutorial</a> at the upcoming <a href="http://compute.acmbangalore.org/cfp10.html">Compute 2010 conference</a> in Bangalore on building applications using Facebook Connect. Here is what we will go through:
<ul>
	<li>What is Facebook Connect and what are the benefits of using it.</li>
	<li>A simple application for logging into a site using FB Connect, perform an activity and post a news feed on Facebook</li>
	<li>Advanced capabilities of Facebook Connect (ex. sending email to the user)</li>
	<li>Integrating with your login/signup mechanism</li>
	<li>A note on the terms and policies of FB Connect</li>
</ul>
Prerequisites: The tutorial will assume familiarity with Facebook platform and working knowledge of Ruby and Javascript.

Hope to see you there! If you are a startup, you can apply for some free passes. More information <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/headstart-network/browse_thread/thread/493ddc87f5651fbf">here</a>.
