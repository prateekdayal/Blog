Lately I have been finding that firefox is eating up so much memory in my system. After long usage (with even few tabs open), the memory usage on my system shoots up to a crazy 500 MB + which is insane. I have seen this a couple of times now and there are other people who have reported that firefox hangs on their system too.This issue I have never seen before Firefox 2.0.0.6. I personally find it really sad and I am planning to move over to Safari in windows. The font rendering is not as exciting as firefox but otherwise i find it to be pretty neat.  I would love to know if there is a patch to fix this in firefox
