I am very excited (as is everyone else) on <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial's</a> launch. Most of the users for <a href="http://muziboo.com">Muziboo.com</a> are members of orkut and we are planning to roll out a few applications over the next week or so to help them showcase their music to their friends.

The great thing about open social is 'learn once write everywhere'   as it is based on good old Javascript, HTML and XML. From what I have read so far, it is based on google gadgets architecture with a social context added to it.

Watch out for some nice apps from Muziboo .... Do join up and start uploading your music there and we will make it even easier for the world to take notice soon :)
