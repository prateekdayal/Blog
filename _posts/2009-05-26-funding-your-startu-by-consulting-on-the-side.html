<p>I was part of the panel discssion at the  <a href="http://entrypreneur.blogspot.com/2009/05/xtreme-starups-iim-bangalore.html">xtremestartups</a> event on Sunday and one of the topics we discussed was funding a startup by consulting on the side. I strongly believe in two things - bootstrapping and working full-time on one's startup - but there are real <a href="http://www.prateekdayal.net/2009/05/20/costs-involved-in-starting-up/">costs involved in starting up</a> that one needs to take care of. In case one doesn't  have enough money saved up, consulting is the only feasible option (other than getting funded). It's best to avoid even consulting (by running a lean and mean start-up) as it takes one's focus off the start-up. But most times it is inevitable and I recommend the following tips to make the best out of your consulting stint.</p>
<p><strong>Pick the right projects</strong></p>
<p>Of all the things that I have learnt about consulting, this is the most important one. Here are a few guidelines that can help you pick the right projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Charge by the hour and never opt for fixed budget projects however-much enticing they are. All software projects tend to get delayed. The delays don't mean much if you are in the consulting business, but if you are trying to raise cash for your startup, every extra day lost  reduces your product development runway. If billing is by the hour, you can make sure that such delays don't hurt you. It also makes sure that you get only relevant change requests (since the client is paying for every hour spent).</li>
<li>Pick projects that you like working on and teach you things that can be applied to your own idea. For example, if you are planning to work on an e-commerce portal (or want to add a payment gateway to your existing product), you can pick up a similar project and learn relevant stuff there.</li>
<li>Don't mind dirty maintenance jobs as they are short and well-paid. As engineers, we tend to love working from scratch and hate fixing bugs in someone else's code. End-to-end product development cannot be delivered in a few sittings unlike a well defined back end work. Also you will make big bucks  in projects that are already live, because  your contribution as a subject matter expert  is extremely important for the company in fixing its product.</li>
<li>On a related note, avoid projects that involve working on the UI. These jobs involve talking to the designer, taking the CEO's viewpoint on buttons/boxes and cross browser hell. Compare this to backend work, where you can work all by yourself, whenever you want and finish the job much more quickly. You want to avoid any sort of job that has too many stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't grow your consulting business</strong></p>
<p>Once you pick up a project, there are inevitably more such project offers coming your way and most often you will be tempted to hire a couple of freshers and a manager and spin off a consulting business - an amazingly self sustained money generating machine of a business that requires minimal effort  that can keep funding your product development. If you go down that Utopian path, before long you would realize that most of your time is spent in business development, following up on payments, motivating your employees and other mundane activities. If product company is what you want to build, do not shift focus. Take up just as much  as you can do than sinking into the quagmire of a services business. The cash reserve that you build should be just enough to give a decent runway for growing your startup.</p>
<p><strong>Get Paid</strong></p>
<p>While this looks like the most obvious one, many people make a mistake here. As engineers, we tend to charge based on our needs and not our skill set and its value in the market. Talk to  few of your peers and figure out how much to charge before you quote. Don't charge lesser than the market rate and make sure that you get paid. Sometimes, your clients are too busy and paying you may not be the top priority item in their to-do list. Follow up and get paid. If possible, take an advance payment before starting out and decide on milestones for remaining payment.</p>
<p><strong>You can't always balance it right</strong></p>
<p>One more setback which is not quite obvious on first glance is the time-sink that can happen due to continuous context switching between consulting projects and your start-up idea. Consulting is going to take your focus away for a while and your startup's growth may suffer because of that. The idea is to accept that upfront and not let it bring you down. The last thing you wanna do is to end up demotivated. If you are working all day on consulting projects, there is no point  forcing yourself to work on your startup at night. There is only so much one can code every day and any spare time should be used to reflect upon your  start-up's growth and strategy. If you are adventurous, you can also use this break to catch up on your reading or hang out with friends :)</p>
<p>In the end, figure out what works best for you and do it. Idea is to make some money, learn something new and have some fun. When you get back fulltime to your startup, you should be richer and invigorated!</p>
