Social Networking is a very competitive space and every one believes their network is the best. But what bolder way to claim it than to have an ad on your competitors website saying you are better. Something like this caught my attention today on <a href="http://in.myspace.com">in.myspace.com</a> where I saw an ad from <a href="http://minglebox.com">minglebox</a> asking the reader "Bored of myspace?" and then went on in the subject to say something like "come to minglebox, discover new friends etc ... "

Here is a screenshot below

I am not sure what more is one going to get there. I have used minglebox personally and I don't see what can excite one there if you are bored of *any* social network
