Its very interesting to watch the reaction of people when we tell them that we run an online music community. Most people think that we run a social network and dismiss it right away. A few people get curious and ask us to explain the concept. Very few people we meet already understand the difference. I think thats because online communities are still not very popular in India. There are a few popular forums like <a href="http://www.team-bhp.com/web/">TeamBHP</a> that have a strong community element, but only a handful of such sites exist. In this post I would try to explain is the difference between a social network and an online community and why the dynamics are completely different.

<strong>Who do you know <em>Already</em></strong>

I think this is one of the key difference between an online community and a social network. More often than not a person joins Orkut or Facebook to connect with people she knows already. They could be old classmates, colleagues or friends from college. The main intent here is to reconnect and stay in touch. A few people go to such sites to find new connections but as far as I know, it does not work very well .. specially on a network like facebook that has strong privacy settings.

Contrast this with an online community. You go there because you are interested in the theme of the community. In case of <a href="http://muziboo.com">muziboo</a>, that happens to be Music. Music that you create. Most of our users come to Muziboo to showcase their music to people who care about such home made music. When a user joins an online community, chances are she does not know most people there and is looking to form some connections (mostly online) with people who share the same interest. You are not on an online community to talk about your work, personal life, relationship status, your last trip and ten other things. You are there for just one reason only ... your interest. Online communities serve a niche and serve it well.

<strong>Mindset towards making new connections</strong>

In orkut you would find several profiles (mostly of women) who express that they would not accept friendship requests from people they don't know. In a social network, your profile is a representation of you in the online world. Your connections, communities your join reflect on you and along with your profile information give people an idea of who your are. So most people prefer not to connect with strangers (again more so in case of facebook) because they would be associated with them in someway.

In an online community, your profile is just a part of your real self. So in case of Muziboo your profile is a representation of your musical self. Your connections there are people you admire musically or who like your music. You are open to adding more friends or contacts because all your care is that they would help you in getting better in your passion. Since you know most people are there for a specific reason, you are more likely to talk to them even if you have not known them before. Its the same reason why I think groups in <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> for a certain city (say bangalore) meetup in real life every now and then and orkut meets hardly ever materialize.

<strong>Culture or Spirit of the place</strong>

Both social networks and online communities try to stay neutral. They don't have opinions. They don't dictate what you should do (there are however guidelines as to what not to do). However an online community does have a culture that you can feel once you have spent sometime there. For example, when I started using flickr, it took me very little time to figure out that I can go and comment on anyone's picture and then request them for a comment. I could quickly find out that groups are a great way to find people who are interested in some specific kind/aspect of photography
and so on. This culture or spirt is defined by the people in the community but the creators of the place initially play a big roll in shaping it. Which brings me to my last point for today's post

<strong>Nurturing the place v/s letting it be</strong>

An online community has to be nurtured. Specially in India or similar place where conventionally we have not looked at online world as a place to learn or pursue something serious. Social networks on the other hand don't really need nurturing. You don't need to greet new users and tell them they should comment on other people's stuff. If a social network is all about the number of users and connections they have, an online community is all about the number of comments they make or the number of group discussions users initiate. To achieve that, community managers have to work very hard till the place carries that vibe all by itself. The concept of a community manager is absent in social networks as I know.
I would be very interested in knowing your thoughts on this article. Have you beenÂ  part of an online community before? If yes, please do tell us about it and how your experience was. Do you think social network's groups can serve as online communities?
