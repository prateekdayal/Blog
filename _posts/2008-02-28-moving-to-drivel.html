I have mostly found blogging to be tough as I have to login to my blog and then add a post .. a number of clicks and quite a few page loads

I today installed <a href="http://dropline.net/drivel/">Drivel</a> on ubuntu and this is my first blog post using it 

If everything goes as planned, I plan to blog a lot more .. mostly about Ruby on Rails and thoughts on starting up .. things that I come across during my <a href="http://muziboo.com" title="Upload your music">Muziboo Journey</a>
