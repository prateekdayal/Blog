Last week, <a href="http://www.nithyadayal.com/blog">Nithya</a> and I made a quick trip to Cambodia. We took a <a href="http://www.thesinhtourist.com/">SinhTourist</a> tour from Ho Chi Minh (more about that later). In the four days that we were in Cambodia, we checked out Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. Here is a quick trip log and some pictures (some of the pictures may be unsuitable for people who are shocked easily).

Ideally you need a lot more time to explore this interesting country and I am sure that I am going back there sometime to live and work from there for a few months.
