I recently lost my glasses and had to go out and get a new pair done. I had almost the similar experience that I have had many times before at stores in Bangalore (and I think elsewhere). You walk into a chain (like GKB opticians) and you can see the disinterested look in the sellers there. Its the same for a lot of malls like More, Foodworld etc. The sellers (or sales people) there do not own the store (or a part of it) and therefore seem to have no vested interest in selling. They would be clueless about the basic stuff and would never persuade you into buying something.

Compare this to a traditional store where the owner is the salesman (or atleast there in the store). They would always be very keen on selling you. They have a vested interest in selling you stuff and it shows. They would never mind if you are not satisfied with 10 things they have shown you already. They would show you 10 more and hope you buy one of them. I am sure a lot of chains in Bangalore can learn something from this.

There are also some chains like <a href="http://bigbazaar.com/" rel="nofollow">Big Bazaar</a> who have enthusiastic salesmen. I think that is one of the main reason (besides cost) why people go and shop there. Its so easy to find something there by asking the sales guy. If you have a store (or a startup), you need to make sure someone is selling hard or you would be losing out on a lot of business.
