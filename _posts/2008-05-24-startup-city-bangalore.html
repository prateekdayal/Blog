<em>This is more of a ... look at the pictures .. they tell the story ... post :)</em>

We went to the much awaited (or rather publicized) <a href="http://www.thesmarttechie.com/startupcity/">startup city</a> today. We reached around noon and found a lot of crowd there. The event looked like a trade fair and there were banners and balloons all over the place.

The event was in Nimhans convention centre and the good thing was that there was tons of parking space available. Once inside, we found the place to be really crowded, which I guess was <a href="http://www.pluggd.in/2008/05/smarttechies-startupcity-event-coverage">good</a> for the companies showcasing there.

<a href="http://bangaloreocc.blogspot.com">Open Coffee Club</a> also had a booth there and I found <a href="http://technofriends.in">Vaibhav</a> and Amarinder evangelizing OCC. I think these guys are doing an awesome job of spreading the OCC and keeping the meets interesting.

Several OCC companies were also demoing their products/services there. For example <a href="http://lifeblob.com">LifeBlob</a>

We also met Sameer and Nandhini of Madhouse (now SeventyMM) and had a good discussion with them on Indian startup scene. These guys have great experience building and selling a company and it was fun talking to them.

We did not attend any talks or discussions and spent most of the time catching up with other people. Overall I got more of a trade fair feeling out of Startup City. There were stalls of Amazon, Nokia and HSBC right at the entrance :) The event certainly did not feel like a real startup event. I am not sure how to describe that feel .. I guess it wasn't boostrapper's event (except for the OCC booth).
