Last month I finally Â bought an iPhone (3GS). So far I have absolutely loved using it and even though its a bit expensive I think it's totally worth having. Here are a few things that I really like

<strong>Camera</strong>

The iPhone camera is only 3 MegaPixel but it takes great pictures. I have not played around with the video recording much but here is one shot that I took using the iPhone

<strong>App Ecosystem</strong>

I downloaded a few apps and was blown away by the number of apps available on the platform. There is an app available for every need. Here are some of the apps that I use almost daily now
<ul>
	<li>Twitter for iPhone</li>
	<li>Google's App (for muziboo mail, google reader)</li>
	<li>Notes (comes bundled with iPhone)</li>
	<li>Clock (comes bundled with iPhone. You can add clocks for different timezones and see them at once)</li>
	<li>Safari (comes bundled)</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
</ul>
I also downloaded and tried out a few racing games. Even though I am not a gaming freak, I was very impressed by the games available on the iPhone. The responsive accelerometer makes most games on the iPhone a lot of fun.

<strong>SMS/Push Notifications</strong>

I liked the fact that you don't have to unlock your iphone to view short sms and push notifications from apps like Facebook and Mail. It's very handy and saves a lot of time if you are a heavy messaging user (who isn't?)

<strong>The not so great things</strong>

To keep it fair, there are somethings I did not like about the iPhone.
<ul>
	<li>Even though there is 16GB built in storage, you cannot use iPhone as a USB drive (something I could do with Nokia 5800)</li>
	<li>Slide to answer call</li>
	<li>Need to use iTunes to transfer music and videos</li>
	<li>The not so great battery life (its better w/o wifi but still not as great)</li>
	<li>Some apps which don't change orientation, forcing me to type on the smaller keyboard (Gmail for example)</li>
	<li>A common cable for usb and the charger, forcing you to buy an expensive accessory or unplug the cable from your computer everytime you wanna use the wall charger</li>
</ul>
Overall its a great phone and a great investment. I think the iOS4 update should make it an even better phone.
