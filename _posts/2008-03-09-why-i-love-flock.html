Its official now. What started as a casual lemme check it out is turning into a more serious affair. I have to say I am almost in love with the flock browser. It totally rocks

Why does flock rock. In the last 2 weeks that I have used flock, I have come to love the fact that it understands that I am a human and I spend a lot of time on my social interaction. It knows that I blog, I upload pictures on flickr, I have friends all over the world (rather cyber world) and makes sure that I don't spend a lot of time trying to manage all this. Everything is neatly presented to you on your about:myworld page. This is when I still have not spent more than 20 mins configuring it or whatever. 

Now comes why I don't like flock. Flock has safari kind of fonts and right now on my ubunut amd64 nvidia system, they don't rock as much. They are kinda smudged and I am hoping the flock team will fix it

And oh .. btw .. I am talking about Flock 1.1 beta ... &nbsp;&nbsp;
