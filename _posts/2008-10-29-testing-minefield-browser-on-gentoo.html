I recently got to know on twitter about <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/">minefield</a>. Its basically Firefox 3.1 beta release and its awesome. I use <a href="http://gentoo.org">gentoo</a> linux 2008.0 (AMD 64 bit version) and I had been using a 32 bit firefox (2.0.0.14) on it so I can use flash. I had also installed a flock 2.0 beta to use firefox 3 like features. I could never however get firefox 3.0 working on my system. There would always be some .so file missing.

I was therefore pleasantly surprised when the tarball for minefield just worked. Flash works though other plugins and extensions (such as firebug) don't. However the browser has a very smooth finish, is very fast and a pleasure to use. There is some problem with fonts on few pages sometimes (size not correct etc) but thats expected in a beta release. However I have been using minefield as my primary browser for about a week and its been great so far.

Do give it a try and let me know what you think. Remember, its a beta and not a stable release.
