Last month I finally took the plunge and bought a 15'' <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Macbook Pro</a>. Since I was traveling to Ho Chi Minh, I stopped over at Singapore and bought it from the iStore on Terminal 3. Apple Singapore prices are cheaper than India and if you buy at the airport, you don't even have to pay the 7% tax.

I have now been using the macbook for over a month now and I can confidently say that it's the best computer I have owned so far. There are things about the mac that make it the best development machine ever. One of the best features for me is the fast sleep and wake up. You almost never have to wait for the laptop to wake up. As soon as you open the lid, its back up. There is a nice battery level indicator on the left side that you can use to query the battery status even with the lid closed. Also, the battery lasts for a long times so you never have to really shutdown your laptop (and lose the workspace)

The hardware is really top notch. The trackpad is the best I have seen so far and mouse gestures are really useful. The sound quality is awesome and the screen super crisp. It works really well with external keyboard, mouse and displays and so when you are in office, you can use it as a desktop. Apple desktop keyboards have the same layout and spacing as their laptop keyboards so you will never feel any difference.

On the software side, it comes bundled with iPhoto and Garageband so you have some good apps to begin with. The inbuilt pdf viewer is very good too. Also, there are some really good free applications available for mac, especially for developers (for example GitX)

I think macbook is totally worth the money if you can afford it. Its a little expensive but no other laptop comes even close. They can probably match up or do better on the processor speed or RAM but as a package (hardware + software), nothing beats the macbook.
