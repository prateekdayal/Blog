You are working hard on your startup and you meet tons of new people every week and tell them about your startup. If you are lucky, probably 1% of them would love your startup and show it.  This is certainly true in our case. If I go to a barcamp or OCC or other startup events, less than 1% of the people there are excited to hear about <a href="http://muziboo.com">Muziboo</a>. Most people dismiss the concept as yet another social network (about which I wrote <a href="http://prateekdayal.net/blog/2008/05/16/how-online-community-is-different-from-social-network/">here</a>).

Before I go any further, let me accept that I too am very rarely excited about someone's idea. I guess this <a href="http://prateekdayal.net/blog/2008/04/20/barcamp-bangalore-6-rocked/">barcamp</a> there was only one startup, <a href="http://lifeblob.com">LifeBlob</a> that truly excited me. Last barcamp, it was <a href="http://prateekdayal.net/blog/2007/12/05/flipkartcom-finally-a-reasonably-priced-online-bookstore-in-india/">flipkart</a>. So what I am trying to say is that the post is not about why people don't love my startup but about who is the best critique for my startup.

<strong>Are Startup Events or B-plan contests best critique?</strong>

Honestly, I don't think so. I have never applied for a B-Plan contest but I have not even seen too many success stories coming out of there.  I define success as some company that won in a b-plan contest and then got into business and eventually survived and made a profitable business.

Lets talk about startup events. We applied last year for <a href="http://proto.in">proto.in</a> and were rejected. In the true startup spirit, I did take some learnings out of it but then I was confused all the more on finding out that <a href="http://saffronconnect.com">Saffron Connect</a> (link won't work .. the site disappeard) had presented in the first proto.in. Even if I look at the last proto, there are startups that have not even launched and have had  a chance to present. I would put <a href="http://headstart.in">HeadStart.in</a> in the same league. We were rejected there too, only that we did not even receive a rejection letter. We had to call and ask the organizers about the results and the guy I called was clueless. Proto and Headstart in my opinion should take out sometime to write to the companies rejected so that they can take some useful learning out of the whole experience. Untill they do that, I dont think they are the best critique for your startup.

These events reminds me of my school that used to kick out every average guy (academically) and  keep only the best of the best and then show a great success story in every board exam. How those people have fared in life after school is a different story. I therefore believe a true startup ecosystem should help those who need it. Pruning and showcasing the best is only a part of the story. I love <a href="http://bangaloreocc.blogspot.com">OCC</a> and <a href="http://startupsaturday.in">Startup Saturday</a> for that the help they offer to one and all and I think they will go out to become the most useful startup events in the next few years.

<strong>Is it the experts in your domain?</strong>

To some extent .. yes .. the experienced people in the domain can offer you some really good insights. We have been fortunate to meet some people who can give us good legal, financial or sometimes even common sense perspective on things. However I feel that there are very very few people in the web space right now in India who can be called experts. This is true all the more in web 2.0 space. User generated content sites are always dismissed by most experts on design, scalability, VCability or similar front. I am sure had I pointed out craigslist or flickr or even a facebook to them in the early days, they would have dismissed them too. If you give point the same examples now, they would still dismiss them terming them as an one off thing. But thats exactly the point, most startups are one off successes. Its very tough to spot trends in successful startups. Still most experts or events are trying to spot the trends when declaring winners or potential winners. They are looking for the coolest technology or the most scalable idea or the most VCable business. How is it then that the deadpool list keeps getting longer?

I guess its a combination of luck, persistence, execution and idea (in that order) that determines success. So then who is the best critique?

<strong>Your users are your best critique</strong>

Yes .. thats it .. its your users. If people come to your site/product and use it and recommend it, you are doing well. If not, time to improve. Its really as simple as that. If you are onto one of those one off successes, there would be a lot of early adopters who would swear by your service and use it regularly. They would evangelize it like its their baby. If you cannot find many such evangelists, then you are not doing something truly useful. If you look back at the examples I mentioned before, craigslist, flickr, macintosh all had tons of evangelists in the community. I therefore think that if users love you, you have a good chance of succceeding. Everything else is useful but not mandatory. To pick better words, every other review (or the lack of it) about you cannot make or break you.

Feel free to debate my thoughts. Again in no way do I consider Muziboo successful <em>yet</em>. However I do believe that we are onto something and we will hopefully get there if we can survive for that long. I am thankful to a lot of people who did/are helping us on a daily basis and ofcourse to our users.

That said, I feel its time for the startup <em>egosystem</em> to start morphing into an true <em>ecosystem</em>.
