Today was google's first developer day in India at Chancery Pavilion, Bangalore. I had registered a couple of weeks back and could get into the otherwise sold out event. Here is a brief of the event.

<strong>Keynote</strong>

The keynote by Dr. Prasad talked about how google's mission is about improving the Client, Cloud and Connectivity. There were a couple of videos about the journey of google and some demos on Chrome (Client), App Engine (Cloud) and Android (Connectivity).

<strong>Tech Tracks</strong>

I attended two tech tracks

<strong>Indic Languages</strong>

A demo of two of the indic products (both backed by API)
<ul>
	<li>Transliteration</li>
	<li>Translation</li>
</ul>
The code is available at <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/">http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/</a>

<strong>Google Maps API</strong>

A demo and overview of the google maps API. Interesting statistics for why maps
<ul>
	<li>80% of the world has never moved beyond 20 miles of their birthplace</li>
	<li>80% of your expenses are local (even apart from real estate)</li>
	<li>You can monetize using adsense for maps (more local than regular adsense)</li>
</ul>
Use of KML (Keyhole map launguage) file. Its a sort of a DTD that lets you paint on a map. It saves development time (since you don't have to talk to db etc) and it can be indexed by search engines. You can use KML editors like 'My Maps' (web based).  You can also use maplet (its like a light weight application overlayed on top of google maps). Users can overlay differenent maplets over the same map.

After the tech tracks, lunch was served. All through the day, there were beverages available outside the rooms. Post lunch there were code labs and I attended the code lab for google maps. The team demo'd a small map based game and discussed the code. Both the application and the turorial can be found at <a href="http://maps-gdd2008.appspot.com/">http://maps-gdd2008.appspot.com/</a>. After this there was another code lab but I left.

It was an interesting day. Google speakers were pretty awesome and I thing that I found amazing was that they were very keen on getting feedback on their tools and api from the audience.  I also found every googler using chrome and deploying all their sample code on app engine. A true eat your own dog food environment.

Also there were lots of free goodies like a 2 GB USB drive, a free t-shirt, notepads, keyring etc to make the geeks happy :)
