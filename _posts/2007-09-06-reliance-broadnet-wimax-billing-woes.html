I got reliance wimax connection about a month and a half back and I would say its pretty good in terms of speed (I am on the Rs 750/-, 4 GB download plan) but bad in some other ways and nightmarish in some actually. Technically speaking  the service goes down for like a day almost every week. This is very frustrating as it comes back predictably in the evening.

Another big issue is with their billing. I got a call today saying that my last bill is about Rs 2100. This came as a shock to me as I am on the Rs 750 a month plan with 4 GB download free in that. Now I am pretty sure that I have not crossed the 4 GB download limit. Now this portal reliancebroadband.co.in is pretty unusable because most things don't work very well.  Half the time it says your usage details cannot be shown as system is going upgradatation !!!! (They can bill me for that usage but cannot show it ..)

I go back and check the usage for the 1 month and it shows me for the first 15 days ... Here is a snapshot of one of the screens

As you can see in the screen on 27th I have used around 397000+ MBs which is around 400 GB. With this kind of billing sofware, they have sent me a bill of 2k+. I check my unbilled usage (for about a week and it says 3 GB! and after I complained it started showing as 1.2 GB .. great !)

Now comes the worst part: I register a complaint by emailing them (The guy on call won't take the complaint). I get acknowledged for the email with a complaint number and next day my internet connection is disconnected. I call up and the guy says I should pay my bill and he cannot give me more details. I send another email and after sometime a guy calls me to say that please go to a webworld and pay Rs 3k . Now this is ridiculous .. My due date for bill is 13th September and I am being asked to pay the last bill and some more already on 6th September. There is no email or call before disconnecting my internet. I had paid my last bill before the due date so there is no justification for this. As an ISP you cannot cut my internet connection whenever you want without any notice and before even the due date for the payment is passed.

I am still waiting for the resolution for this but I wanted to write about it so that people can read and think and then go for this connection. I am sure a few thousand per month is a lot of money for internet connection in India.
